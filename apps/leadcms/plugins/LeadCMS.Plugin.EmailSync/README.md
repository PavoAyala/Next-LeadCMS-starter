## IMAP Account Management

### Adding IMAP Accounts

IMAP accounts are managed through the LeadCMS interface via the IMAP Accounts controller:

- **POST `/api/imap-accounts`** - Add new IMAP account
- **GET `/api/imap-accounts`** - List configured IMAP accounts
- **PUT `/api/imap-accounts/{id}`** - Update IMAP account settings
- **DELETE `/api/imap-accounts/{id}`** - Remove IMAP account

### IMAP Account Configuration

Each IMAP account requires the following configuration:

**Basic Settings:**
- **Host**: IMAP server hostname (e.g., imap.gmail.com)
- **Port**: IMAP server port (typically 993 for SSL)
- **Username**: Email account username
- **Password**: Email account password (encrypted when stored)
- **Use SSL**: Enable SSL/TLS encryption (recommended)

**Sync Settings:**
- **Enabled**: Enable/disable synchronization for this account
- **Folders**: Specific folders to synchronize (default: INBOX)
- **Since Date**: Start date for email synchronization
- **Max Messages**: Maximum number of messages to sync per session

### Supported Email Providers

The plugin works with any IMAP-compatible email provider:

**Gmail:**
- Host: `imap.gmail.com`
- Port: `993`
- SSL: `true`
- Note: Requires app passwords if 2FA is enabled

**Microsoft Outlook/Office 365:**
- Host: `outlook.office365.com`
- Port: `993`
- SSL: `true`
- Note: May require OAuth authentication for some accounts

**Yahoo Mail:**
- Host: `imap.mail.yahoo.com`
- Port: `993`
- SSL: `true`

**Custom IMAP Servers:**
- Configure host, port, and SSL settings as provided by your email provider

## Email Classification Logic

### Internal Domain Detection

Emails are classified as internal when:
- Sender domain matches configured internal domains
- Recipient domain matches configured internal domains
- Email originates from company email addresses

### External Communication Detection

Emails are classified as external when:
- At least one participant is from an external domain
- Communication involves leads or customers
- Email represents customer service or sales communication

### Ignored Email Filtering

Emails are excluded from synchronization when:
- Sender address matches ignored email patterns
- Email contains automated/system-generated markers
- Email is identified as spam or promotional content
- Email is from known automated systems (notifications, alerts, etc.)
